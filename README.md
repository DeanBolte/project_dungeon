# Project Dungeon (Temp Name)
This is a small game that I have designed to be easily implemented for a beginning game dev like myself. It has a small scope but has plenty of room to expand and grow if I decide there is anything specific that I would want to try out.

## Change Log
### Version 0.1 Raw Update
- Player Controls and movement including a dodge mechanic with iframes.
- Three enemy types: melee, single shot and burst shot.
- Two shot types: standard and slug.
- Basic level procedural generation.
- Plus a whole bunch of setting up stuff in project for later.
